# 🌍 Wanderlust – Hotel Listing Platform

🧭 Introduction
Wanderlust is a full-stack hotel and travel accommodation listing platform built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js) stack and EJS templating on the frontend. It is inspired by platforms like Airbnb and Yelp, but focused primarily on helping users discover, list, and review hotels across different cities worldwide.

The goal of this project is to provide an intuitive, feature-rich application where:

🌍 Travelers can explore hotels in cities around the world using an interactive map, view detailed amenities, check prices, and read/write reviews.

🏨 Property owners or admins can create and manage listings with multiple images, location geocoding, and secure access control.

💻 Developers and recruiters can see a practical example of a full-stack application using real-world practices like RESTful routing, secure authentication, form validation, file handling (Cloudinary), map APIs (Mapbox), and MVC-based folder structuring.

This project was built as a learning experience to strengthen skills in:

Server-side rendering using EJS

Express middleware and route handling

Database modeling and schema validation using Mongoose and Joi

Authentication/authorization logic with Passport.js

Integrating third-party APIs (Cloudinary, Mapbox)

Frontend logic including form validation and flash messages
